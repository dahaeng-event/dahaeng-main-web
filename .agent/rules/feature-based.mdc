### Feature-Based Architecture Guidelines

This project follows a **Feature-Based Architecture**. Code is organized by **business features** rather than technical layers.

#### Core Structure

- `src/features/` : Contains all business logic, UI, and state specific to a feature.
- `src/components/` : Shared UI components (Buttons, Inputs, Layouts) that are domain-agnostic.
- `src/hooks/` : Shared custom hooks used across multiple features.
- `src/lib/` (or `utils/`) : Shared utility functions and helpers.
- `src/pages/` (or `app/`) : Routing and page composition.

#### Feature Directory Structure

Each folder in `src/features/` represents a specific business domain (e.g., `auth`, `payment`, `profile`).
Inside a feature folder, group files by their function:

```
src/features/auth/
├── components/    # Feature-specific UI components
├── hooks/         # Feature-specific hooks
├── api/           # API calls and data fetching logic
├── types/         # TypeScript types for this feature
├── utils/         # Helper functions for this feature
├── index.ts       # Public API (optional, for cleaner imports)
└── stores/        # Feature-specific state stores (Zustand, etc.)
```

#### Dependency Rules

1.  **Features can import from Shared**: Features can freely import from `components`, `hooks`, `lib`, and `types`.
2.  **Features should avoid importing from other Features**:
    -   Try to keep features independent.
    -   If Feature A needs Feature B, consider:
        -   Moving the shared logic to `shared` (e.g., `components` or `hooks`).
        -   Composing them at the Page level.
        -   Using a global store or event system for communication.
3.  **Pages compose Features**: Pages should primarily import features and layout components to build the screen.

#### Colocation

-   Keep related code close. If a component, hook, or utility is only used in one feature, put it in that feature's folder.
-   Don't prematurely extract code to shared folders (`components`, `hooks`) unless it's used in multiple places.
