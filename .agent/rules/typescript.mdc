### TypeScript Guidelines

- Avoid using `as` casts and try to use satisfies operator instead.
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
